## Key Components of the Directory Tree

- `README.md` and `LICENSE`: Basic project information and licensing details.
- `Hardware`: Contains all hardware design files, including schematics, PCB layouts, 3D models, and Bill of Materials (BOM).
- `Firmware`: Houses the source code and compiled binaries for any firmware running on the hardware.
- `Simulation`: For quantum models and environmental test simulations relevant to space applications.
- `Documentation`: Technical specifications, design documents, and user manuals.
- `Testing`: Includes unit tests and integration tests for both hardware and software components.
- `Tools`: Custom tools or scripts developed for the project, such as KiCAD extensions or utility programs.

This directory structure is just an example and can be modified to better fit the specific needs of your project. It's crucial to maintain a well-organized and documented project, especially when dealing with complex designs like quantum computing hardware for space applications.
