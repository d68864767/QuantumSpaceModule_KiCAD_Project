# Design Rationale

This document outlines the design rationale behind the Quantum Space Module KiCAD Project. The project involves the design and development of a complex quantum computing product for space applications.

## Hardware Design

The hardware design is divided into two main parts: the MainBoard and the PowerSupply. The MainBoard houses the quantum computing components, while the PowerSupply ensures stable and reliable power delivery to these components.

### MainBoard

The MainBoard is designed with a focus on maximizing computational power while minimizing size and power consumption. The schematic and PCB layout for the MainBoard can be found in the `Hardware/Schematics/MainBoard/` and `Hardware/PCB_Layout/MainBoard_Layout/` directories respectively.

### PowerSupply

The PowerSupply is designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space and provide stable power to the MainBoard. The schematic and PCB layout for the PowerSupply can be found in the `Hardware/Schematics/PowerSupply/` and `Hardware/PCB_Layout/PowerSupply_Layout/` directories respectively.

## Firmware Design

The firmware for the Quantum Space Module is written in C for efficiency and low-level control. The source code can be found in the `Firmware/SourceCode/` directory, and the compiled binaries in the `Firmware/Binaries/` directory.

## Simulation

Simulations play a crucial role in the design and testing of the Quantum Space Module. Quantum models are used to simulate the behavior of the quantum computing components, while environmental tests simulate the conditions the module will face in space. These simulations can be found in the `Simulation/QuantumModels/` and `Simulation/EnvironmentalTests/` directories respectively.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is provided to ensure the Quantum Space Module can be understood, modified, and used effectively. This includes technical specifications, design documents, and user manuals, which can be found in the `Documentation/` directory.

## Testing

Testing is an integral part of the development process. Unit tests are used to verify the functionality of individual components, while integration tests ensure that these components work together as expected. The tests can be found in the `Testing/UnitTests/` and `Testing/IntegrationTests/` directories respectively.

## Tools

Custom tools and scripts have been developed to assist with the design and development process. These include KiCAD extensions and utility programs, which can be found in the `Tools/` directory.

In conclusion, the design of the Quantum Space Module KiCAD Project is driven by the need for a powerful, reliable, and efficient quantum computing product for space applications. The project structure and organization reflect this focus, ensuring that all components are well-structured and easily accessible.
